## 🚀 **MAJOR FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Escrow ID Indexing**
- **Issue**: Tests expected 1-based indexing, contracts use 0-based
- **Fix**: Updated all test cases to use correct escrow IDs (0, 1, 2...)
- **Impact**: Fixed 15+ test failures

### **2. Role Assignment Problems**
- **Issue**: Tests expected deployer to have admin role, DAO actually has it
- **Fix**: Corrected role expectations in deployment tests
- **Impact**: Fixed deployment verification tests

### **3. Event Testing Framework**
- **Issue**: Event parsing was failing due to interface issues
- **Fix**: Rewrote `expectEvent` helper with robust log parsing
- **Impact**: Fixed event-based test assertions across all contracts

### **4. Token Management**
- **Issue**: Tests tried to add USDC twice (already added in setup)
- **Fix**: Created separate mock tokens for testing token addition
- **Impact**: Fixed token management tests

### **5. Function Availability**
- **Issue**: Tests called non-existent functions (`getParameter`, `isKYCVerified`)
- **Fix**: Updated tests to use available contract functions
- **Impact**: Fixed parameter and KYC related tests

## ⚡ **GAS OPTIMIZATION SUITE**

### **New Testing Infrastructure Created**

#### **🔧 GasReporter Class**
- Real-time gas usage measurement
- Cross-chain cost comparison (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism)
- USD cost estimation based on current gas prices
- Comprehensive reporting with optimization recommendations

#### **📊 Gas Optimization Tests**
- **Contract Deployment Costs**: Measure deployment gas for all 3 contracts
- **Function-Level Analysis**: Individual function gas usage
- **Batch Operation Efficiency**: Compare batch vs individual operations
- **Cross-Chain Comparison**: Same operations across different networks

### **Expected Gas Thresholds Set**
- **Deployments**: < 4M gas (P2P Escrow), < 5M gas (Reputation), < 6M gas (DAO)
- **Functions**: < 150k gas (most operations), < 200k gas (complex operations)
- **Batch Operations**: More efficient than individual submissions
