Executive Summary
The Reputation Registry is a decentralized smart contract system that enables multiple platforms to submit and access reputation data in a standardized, transparent manner. It operates on a two-tier authorization model with three distinct access patterns, creating sustainable revenue streams while maintaining openness and decentralization.

Contract Architecture
Authorization Tiers


enum AuthTier {
    NONE,           // Not authorized
    PREPAID,        // Pay $1 per submission
    DAO_APPROVED    // Free unlimited submissions
}
Core Data Structures
Contract Registration


struct ContractInfo {
    AuthTier tier;          // 8 bits - Authorization level
    uint32 weight;          // 32 bits - Reputation weight (0-100)
    uint32 registeredAt;    // 32 bits - Registration timestamp
    uint32 submissionCount; // 32 bits - Total events submitted
    bool active;            // 8 bits - Active status
    // Total: 112 bits (fits in single storage slot)
}
User Status (Contract-Specific)


struct UserStatus {
    uint32 statusValue;     // 32 bits - Numeric status/tier
    uint32 updatedAt;       // 32 bits - Last update timestamp
    uint32 expiryDate;      // 32 bits - Status expiry (0 = no expiry)
    bool active;            // 8 bits - Status active flag
    // Total: 104 bits (fits in single storage slot)
}
Reputation Event


struct ReputationEvent {
    address subject;        // 160 bits - User being rated
    uint32 timestamp;       // 32 bits - Event timestamp
    uint32 value;          // 32 bits - Rating/score value
    uint32 blockNumber;    // 32 bits - Block number
    // Total: 256 bits (exactly one storage slot)
}
Storage Organization


// Main contract registry
mapping(address => ContractInfo) public contractRegistry;
// Credit balances for prepaid contracts
mapping(address => uint256) public creditBalances;
// User statuses: contract -> user -> status
mapping(address => mapping(address => UserStatus)) public userStatuses;
// Reputation events: contract -> subject -> event_type -> events[]
mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => ReputationEvent[]))) private reputationEvents;
// Event existence check (prevent duplicates)
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public eventExists;
Event Types (Standardized)


bytes32 public constant TRADE_COMPLETED = keccak256("trade_completed");
bytes32 public constant DISPUTE_WON = keccak256("dispute_won");
bytes32 public constant DISPUTE_LOST = keccak256("dispute_lost");
bytes32 public constant LOAN_REPAID = keccak256("loan_repaid");
bytes32 public constant SWAP_COMPLETED = keccak256("swap_completed");
bytes32 public constant SERVICE_COMPLETED = keccak256("service_completed");
Core Functions
Registration Functions
Prepaid Contract Registration


function registerPrepaidContract(
    uint256 initialCredits,
    string calldata name
) external
Minimum: $100 USDC initial credits

Default Weight: 50 (can be adjusted by DAO)

Process: Transfer USDC → Register contract → Add credits

DAO Approval


function approveContract(
    address contractAddress,
    uint32 weight,
    string calldata name
) external onlyDAO
Weight Range: 0-100 (DAO decides)

Cost: Free

Use Cases: Strategic partners, your own contracts, public goods

Credit Management
Add Credits


function addCredits(uint256 amount) external
Who: Prepaid contracts only

Process: Transfer USDC → Add to credit balance

Check Balance


function creditBalances(address contractAddr) external view returns (uint256)
Data Submission
Submit Reputation Event


function submitReputationEvent(
    address subject,
    bytes32 eventType,
    uint256 value,
    bytes32 eventId,
    bytes calldata metadata
) external
Authorization Check:

Contract must be active

Prepaid contracts: Deduct $1 USDC from credits per transaction

DAO-approved: Free submission

Duplicate Prevention:

Each eventId can only be used once

Prevents replay attacks and accidental duplicates

Storage:

Event stored in optimized struct (256 bits)

Indexed by contract → subject → event type

Update User Status


function updateUserStatus(
    address user,
    uint32 statusValue,
    uint32 expiryDate
) external
Authorization Check:

Only registered contracts can update user statuses

Prepaid contracts: Deduct $1 USDC from credits per transaction

DAO-approved: Free status updates

Use Cases:

Premium user tier assignments

Verification status updates

Subscription level tracking

Custom platform-specific statuses

Batch Status Updates


function batchUpdateUserStatuses(
    address[] calldata users,
    uint32[] calldata statusValues,
    uint32[] calldata expiryDates
) external
Batch Submission (DAO-Approved Only)


function batchSubmitEvents(
    address[] calldata subjects,
    bytes32[] calldata eventTypes,
    uint256[] calldata values,
    bytes32[] calldata eventIds
) external
Optimization: Multiple events in single transaction

Restriction: Only DAO-approved contracts

Gas Optimization Strategies
Storage Optimization
Packed Structs: Fit data in single storage slots

bytes32 Event Types: More efficient than strings

Efficient Mappings: Nested mappings for direct access

Function Optimization
Batch Operations: Multiple events per transaction

View Functions: No gas cost for reads

Event Emissions: Efficient indexing

Expected Gas Costs
Event Submission: ~50,000 gas (~$2-5 on mainnet, $0.01 on Polygon)

Status Update: ~30,000 gas (~$1-3 on mainnet, $0.005 on Polygon)

Contract Registration: ~100,000 gas

Batch Operations: ~20,000 gas per additional item

Read Operations: Free (view functions)

Security Considerations
Access Control
Tier-based Authorization: Only registered contracts can write

Credit Validation: Prepaid contracts must have sufficient balance

DAO Governance: Controlled approval process

Data Integrity
Event ID Uniqueness: Prevents duplicate submissions

Immutable Events: Once submitted, events cannot be modified

Transparent Storage: All data publicly verifiable

Economic Security
Cost of Attack: $1 per transaction makes spam expensive

Batch Efficiency: Attackers can't game the per-transaction pricing

Weight System: DAO controls reputation influence

Credit Depletion: Malicious actors run out of credits

Deployment Strategy
Multi-Chain Deployment
Ethereum: Primary deployment for maximum security

Polygon: Lower gas costs for high-volume operations

Arbitrum: Alternative L2 for cost efficiency

Cross-Chain: Separate deployments, aggregated by backend

Contract Addresses (Planned)


Ethereum Mainnet: TBD
Polygon: TBD
Arbitrum: TBD
Base: TBD
Governance
DAO Control: Contract approvals, weight adjustments, parameter updates

Upgrade Path: Non-upgradeable contracts for security

Parameter Tuning: Submission costs, weight limits, tier benefits

Revenue Projections
Conservative Scenario (Year 1)
Registered Contracts: 50 prepaid + 10 DAO-approved

Average Monthly Transactions: 2,000 submissions (mix of single/batch)

Monthly Revenue: $2,000 (submissions) + $25,000 (API) = $27,000

Annual Revenue: $324,000

Optimistic Scenario (Year 2)
Registered Contracts: 200 prepaid + 25 DAO-approved

Average Monthly Transactions: 10,000 submissions (high batch usage)

Monthly Revenue: $10,000 (submissions) + $150,000 (API) = $160,000

Annual Revenue: $1,920,000

Success Metrics
Platform Adoption: Number of integrated contracts

Transaction Volume: Monthly submission transactions

Batch Efficiency: Average events per transaction

API Growth: API tier upgrades and usage

Network Effects: Cross-platform reputation queries

Future Enhancements
